Practical 6 -  Data from an online microlending platform has been collected. This data contains details of the purpose for which the loans 
would be used and how the loan is funded. Additional information on the country of loan recipient and the poverty levels of 
the country are also given.
 
It is to be seen whether a loan would be funded or not based on the available data.

# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
# Load the data into a dataframe
data = pd.read_csv('lendingdata.csv')
# Step 1: Determine the number of columns with 'object' data type
object_columns = data.select_dtypes(include=['object']).columns
num_object_columns = len(object_columns)
print(f"Number of columns with 'object' data type: {num_object_columns}")
print(f"Columns with 'object' data type: {object_columns.tolist()}")

# Step 2: Find the total number of missing values in the dataset
total_missing_values = data.isnull().sum().sum()
print(f"Total number of missing values in the data set: {total_missing_values}")

# Step 3: Identify and drop redundant columns
# Assuming 'country_code' is redundant because 'country' is present
columns_to_drop = ['country_code']
data = data.drop(columns=columns_to_drop)
print(f"Columns after dropping redundant information: {data.columns.tolist()}")

# Step 4: Calculate the third quartile value (Q3) of the variable 'loan_amount'
third_quartile_value = data['loan_amount'].quantile(0.75)
print(f"Third quartile value of the variable 'loan_amount': {third_quartile_value}")

# Step 5: Calculate the percentage split of different categories in 'repayment_interval'
# Drop rows with missing values in 'repayment_interval'
repayment_data = data['repayment_interval'].dropna()

# Calculate the percentage split of different categories
percentage_split = repayment_data.value_counts(normalize=True) * 100
print("Percentage split of different categories in 'repayment_interval':")
print(percentage_split)

# Step 6: Find the minimum loan amount disbursed in the Agriculture sector
min_loan_amount_agriculture = data[data['sector'] == 'Agriculture']['loan_amount'].min()
print(f"Minimum loan amount disbursed in the Agriculture sector: {min_loan_amount_agriculture}")
